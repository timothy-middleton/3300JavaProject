# ProjectInformation

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the main concepts taught this semester in a simple way. Learning programming should be done using relatable examples that express the concepts in a way that makes sense in natural language. This is why we do things such as create a function for pets to mate. If we were to teach exceptions as a concept, we would take two pets and ask, “Can they mate?” If they cannot (such as the case with a dog and a cat), we throw an exception due to the impossibility of this situation. If they can, then the child pet will be born (the code block will execute). Learning programming does not have to be difficult and can be done through basic examples such as the ones shown in this project or in class.

The Inputs to the program can first be seen when we our first pet objects. We feed the constructor arguments for name, age, and ancestry (which is a property we decided against using). By the end of this process, we will have eight pets and we output a message to the console for each pet that we have. We can next see inputs in our nest for each loop, in which we attempt to create several more pets by using the pet.mate() method. We expect this to fail and output our custom AnimalSpeciesException because we are calling the method on cats and passing it a dog as a parameter each time. For every failure, the exception will be caught, and we will print an error message to the screen. Following that, we attempt to call the same method twice, but this time we pass the same species pet as a parameter, expecting it to work. Although it is out of place, we also put in a recursive function that performs subtraction repetitively from a large number. Once it reaches the last number it can hit without hitting zero or below, it will print the number to the console. The goal with this was to demonstrate how recursion can be used to perform simple repetitive tasks.

The program is very simple. It does all the work for us. First, we generate some pet objects so we can attempt to breed them. Afterwards, we try breeding the dogs with the cats, expecting that this will fail and throw a different species exception. The last part of the program is executing a recursive function in which we try to get the last number before zero when subtracting from a larger number.
