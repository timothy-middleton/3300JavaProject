# JavaProjectDiscription
Description: Choose a project that you will implement using the JAVA programming language. This project
must be created using a NetBeans IDE. Do not use any other language or IDE. You will also document this 
project in the form of a typed paper and present the project to the class. You may form a group in order to do 
this project but this is not a requirement.

The following are the parts of this project:

  1. Complete JAVA Program
This program must be completed by all members of the group. This program must use at least 2
classes, 1 loop, 1 recursive function, and 1 function that is used for exception handling. This 
function needs to use a Try.. Catch statement in order to achieve exception handling.

In addition to the correctness of your code, part of your grade will be based on how organized your code
is – how easy is it to read and understand. Proper spacing will aid you in this regard. If your 
instructor finds a copy of your code from any other source, everyone in your group will receive a 
0 for this project. You can expand on another person’s code if you have permission. If so, you need to 
explain where you got the code from and what exactly you added to it in your research paper. All code
must be at least 150 lines long.

  2. Research Paper
It will also need to incorporate the following:

a. Why did you choose this project?

b. What does it compute? What are the inputs to and the outputs from your program?

c. Describe how the program works. You can do this part of the paper in the form of a numbered algorithm. It doesn’t need to be in a paragraph if you choose not to.

d. What have you learned from this project?

e. Indicate where the 2 classes, 1 loop, 1 recursive function definition, 1 exception handling function definition are located (state the file and line numbers). This will help me to grade your work faster.

f. Include a UML Diagram for your project.

g. Include a Works Cited page if you used code from other authors.
